This backend project involves building a server for the WTWR (What to Wear) application. WTWR helps users decide what to wear by recommending clothing items based on current weather conditions. Users can add or remove clothing items through the app.

Technologies Used:
Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)

validator.js

Testing the Server:
To ensure the server functions correctly, I used Postman for sending HTTP requests and MongoDB Compass to inspect and manage the database. These tools were essential for validating API endpoints and verifying data operations during development.
